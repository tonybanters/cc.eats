- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep Time: 10 minutes  
- üç≥ Cook Time: 30 minutes  
- üçΩÔ∏è Serves: 2‚Äì3 people

## Ingredients

- 500g pork spare ribs (preferably with cartilage)
- Ginger slices
- 1 tablespoon cooking wine (15ml)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce
- 3 tablespoons rice vinegar
- 4 tablespoons white sugar
- 3g salt
- Enough hot water to cover the ribs
- Sesame seeds (for garnish)
- Cooking oil, as needed

## Instructions

1. Rinse the spare ribs and pat them completely dry with paper towels. Set aside.
2. Heat a small amount of oil in a pan, then add ginger slices and saut√© until fragrant.
3. Add the ribs and stir-fry until they change color and the surface turns golden with slight browning.
4. Add the golden ratio seasonings in order: 1 tbsp cooking wine (poured around the edge of the pan), 2 tbsp soy sauce, 3 tbsp rice vinegar, and 4 tbsp sugar. Mix well.
5. Pour in enough hot water to just cover the ribs. Simmer on medium-low heat for about 20 minutes.
6. Add salt, then turn up the heat to high and reduce the sauce until it‚Äôs thick and glossy. Stir frequently to prevent burning.
7. Once the sauce is well reduced and the ribs are coated with a shiny glaze, sprinkle with sesame seeds and serve.

## Tips

- Use pure pork spare ribs with a bit of cartilage for the best texture and tenderness.
- Be sure the ribs are thoroughly dried before stir-frying to avoid oil splatter.
- When adding cooking wine, pour it along the edge of the pan for even distribution.
- Feel free to adjust the 3:4 ratio of vinegar to sugar based on your preference‚Äîuse more vinegar for a tangier result.
- For a darker color, add a small amount of dark soy sauce when adding the salt at the end.
