![Dry-Fried Cauliflower](/pix/ganbian-caihua.jpg)

A restaurant-style, wok-seared cauliflower dish with crisp edges and deep savory flavor. This dry-fry technique from Hunan cuisine brings out the natural aroma of cauliflower and pork fat. Master a few tricks and you'll get perfectly charred, tender cauliflower every time.

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep Time: 10 minutes  
- üç≥ Cook Time: 10 minutes  
- üçΩÔ∏è Serves: 2‚Äì3 people

## Ingredients

- Half a head of loose cauliflower (or regular cauliflower)  
- 50g pork belly  
- 5g ginger  
- 3 cloves garlic  
- 2 chili peppers  
- 2g salt  
- 15g soy sauce  

## Instructions

1. Rinse and break cauliflower into small florets. Soak in lightly salted water for 10 minutes, then drain thoroughly.
2. In a wok over low heat, slowly render the pork belly to release fat. If the pork isn‚Äôt fatty, add a bit of oil. Once the fat is out, add ginger and stir until fragrant.
3. Increase to high heat. Add cauliflower and spread it out to sear. Let sit for 30 seconds, then stir-fry a few times.
4. Cover with a lid and let steam over medium heat for 30 seconds.
5. Once the edges are slightly browned, add chopped chilies and minced garlic. Stir-fry briefly.
6. Add soy sauce and mix evenly.
7. Just before serving, add salt and toss quickly.
8. Serve hot‚Äîcrispy, fragrant, and perfect with rice.

## Tips

- Loose or organic cauliflower gives the best texture.
- Be sure to drain the cauliflower fully to avoid it becoming soggy.
- High heat is key to keeping it crisp and developing a slight char.
- Add salt at the end to keep it from pulling moisture out too early.
- If using regular cauliflower, blanch it briefly, cool it, and dry thoroughly before stir-frying.
