- **Yellow Croaker Tofu**: Steam small yellow croaker with scallion, ginger, cooking wine, and salt. Debone and use the meat in place of shrimp.
- **Salted Egg Version**: Stir-fry two mashed salted egg yolks in oil until bubbly and sandy. Add tofu and hot water, then proceed as above for extra richness.
- **Extra Ingredients**: Mushrooms, wood ear, bamboo shoots, meatballs, green soybeans, or even julienned asparagus can be added to customize the texture and color.
